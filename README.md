Scripts that I made for fun:

1) Web status checker: checks whether a website is still running

2) youtube_script : Developed a Bash script that retrieves the four most recent videos from my favorite Youtuber using the YouTube Data API and stores the video titles, publication dates, and descriptions in an output file.
